Hello! Welcome to the ScheduleMe project!

Using this project, you can easily create and manage your schedule. Using it is simple, you can compile and run your code in terminal or in an IDE.

If running in an IDE, simply run the main method in the src folder. We recommend running it in IntelliJ IDE

If running in terminal, navigate to the ScheduleMeCOMP350 directory and run the following commands
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
Then the program should be up and running!

Once you run the main method, you'll be prompted to either login or create an account.
Afterwards, the program will guide you through the process of creating and managing your schedule.
You can search for courses, add courses, remove courses, and view your schedule.
Additionally, you can save your schedule so it can be viewed later by logging in to your account and choosing to load an existing schedule, then picking up where you left off!
